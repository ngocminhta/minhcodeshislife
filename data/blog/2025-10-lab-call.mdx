> üí° This blog post is aimed at calling my friends to join with me on topics of uncertainty quantification, fact-checking and detecting machine-generated contents. This research will be carried on at Natural Language Processing department, MBZUAI and [Foundation Models Lab, BKAI Research Center](https://bkai.ai/research/foundation-models/).

# Research topics

We study reliability and factuality of LLMs with two main thrusts: **(1)** principled uncertainty quantification (UQ) for multi-step reasoning and **agentic pipelines**, and **(2)** **multilingual, culturally-aware fact-checking**. The goal is to produce methods, datasets, and open tools that make LLM decisions auditable, efficient, and fair across languages and cultures.

* **UQ for multi-step reasoning:** calibrate step- and chain-level beliefs; propagate uncertainty through tool use/planning; enable selective execution, verification, and test-time scaling under compute budgets.
* **Data-driven UQ for agentic systems:** learn uncertainty from traces/feedback; uncertainty-aware planning and termination; active retrieval/tool calls; budgeted, adaptive decision-making with minimal supervision.
* **Multilingual & cultural-aware fact-checking:** cross-lingual claim normalization and retrieval; culture-specific knowledge grounding; robustness to dialect/code-switching; human-in-the-loop labeling protocols.

Deliverables include open benchmarks, evaluation metrics for step-wise calibration and cross-cultural factuality, and reference implementations deployable in educational and civic-information settings.
