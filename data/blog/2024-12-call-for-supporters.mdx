> 💡 This blog post is aimed at calling my friends (up to 5) to join with me on topic of detecting machine-generated contents, which will be extended as my graduation research thesis by the end of next June. This research will be carried on at [Foundation Models Lab, BKAI Research Center](https://bkai.ai/research/foundation-models/).

# Research topics
The ease of access to large language models (LLMs) has enabled a widespread of machine-generated texts, and now it is often hard to tell whether a piece of text was human-written or machine-generated. This raises concerns about potential misuse, particularly within educational and academic domains. Thus, it is important to develop practical systems that can automate the process.

In academia, especially at HUST, students maybe overuse LLMs for their own purpose, this can lead to some decrease in student's abilities. Hence, my aim is create a system that can detect machine-generated contents in two domains:
* Coding exercises of IT courses (Introduction to Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Applied Algorithms, etc.).
* Students reports for their projects, especially in thesis or capstone projects.

**Small guidance:** I expect to use a small classifier to create a black-box detector (with acceptable quality), and use GAN-architecture to create an explainable detector.
